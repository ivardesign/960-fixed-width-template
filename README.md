# > (Greater than) Small Screen Presentation

At this point the site works and presents fairly well on small screens.  There's a single
break-point at 768px where the mobile 'hamburger' version of the main nav vanishes and we
get an inline set of links. 

   The focus from here on is to get the layout to replicate the original 960px
   fixed-width by the 960px wide point. This could begin at the 768px break-point 
   if possible, otherwise, perhaps another breakpoint will be needed. 
    
   --This doesn't need to be a precise duplication of the original layout, but
   very close.
