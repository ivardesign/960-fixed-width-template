# 960-fixed-width-template Remodel for Responsiveness
## Step One: Getting a Small Screen Presentation Started

  In this branch, the HTML will be "cleaned" and the stylesheet
  will be removed. Viewport Meta will be added to the head of
  the document.

  The new version of the site should have semantic HTML5
  that adapts to screens sized as small as 320px X 480px up to
  1920px wide. 

  Working with small screen presentation only, use the least
  possible CSS to get the bare HTML & content usable. No 
  Hamburger menu at this point, no colors or font assignments
  of any kind, just the exposed links, content and making sure
  the content is presented in the right way. This is the 
  critical CSS that goes directly in the Head of the HTML
  document.  Let the browser do as much work  as possible
  without overriding it to get better accessibility + keep
  your CSS work lighter.
